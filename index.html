    The agreement contained within is for the management of bed bugs. <b>In low and moderate level infestations with proper client cooperation elimination is possible, however, in high level infestations, there is no guarantee that bed bugs will be eliminated or prevented from continuing to infest the treated areas.</b> Bed bugs are an introduced pest and the re-occurrence of bed bugs within the facility can occur at any given time.

                    Follow-up visits will be scheduled at 10-12 days following the initial treatment and will continue at approximately fourteen day intervals until either 1) Control is declared. 2) Client notifies the company that they want the program to end; thereby sacrificing control (Step 5) and elimination (Step 6). If this action is taken no service plan will be granted.  In high level infestations follow-ups may occur more frequently.

The company will consider the appointment confirmed unless we hear directly from the contracting party changing the scheduled appointment.  The client agrees that if the appointment is confirmed and we arrive and cannot gain access to the structure that the client is responsible for 40% of the follow-up treatment and that the treatment must be rescheduled for the full follow-up fee.

            <p>
                During the follow-up visits (but not before the second visit) an evaluation will be made to determine if control has been achieved.  The company will declare ELIMINATION when no more bed bugs are observed during the follow-up visit AND the client has not reported any visible bed bug activity or experienced any bites during the immediate preceding 14 day period.  If bites are occurring or bed bugs are found to be present then follow-up visits will continue (at the above follow-up fee) until ELIMINATION can be declared or client wishes to end the agreement.

        <p>
            The client has a 45 day warranty after ELIMINATION has been declared. It is understood that in some situations, the infestation may never be declared “eliminated”.  In these cases ongoing services will be required to manage the bed bug infestation and no warranty will be granted. <b>If during the elimination and warranty period additional furniture (new or used) is brought into the structure the warranty period may be void.</b>

            Bedbug Specific Terms and Conditions
        </h2>
        <div>
            ** If more than 100 bed bugs are present during the initial visit or subsequent follow ups additional work at additional fees may be necessary
        </div>
        <div>
            **	This service agreement can be terminated at any time by the contracting party with no financial penalty.  However, if the company is contacted at any time in the future for treatment of bed bugs at this location, the treatments are subject to the terms of a new agreement
        </div>
        <div>
            **	The company may revise the fees for future services with notice to the client; to include follow up visits.
        </div>
        <div>
            **	If a representative from the company arrives for a scheduled visit and cannot perform the work due to our inability to gain entry into the structure, or preparations for treatment have not been performed, a charge equivalent to 40% of the charge of the scheduled service will be applied.
        </div>
        <div>
            **	Failure to find visible evidence of bed bugs during an inspection does not insure that the area inspected is free of bugs.
            Bed bugs can easily escape visual detection, particularly when low level infestations are present and during the early stages of an infestation.
        </div>
        <div>
            ** 	Clients will be expected to respond to brief written surveys as part of the follow up procedure.  Failure to respond to these surveys may prevent the infestation from being declared “under control” or “eliminated” and may prolong the length of the program.
        </div>
        <div>
            **	 In low and moderate level infestations with proper client cooperation elimination is possible.  In high level infestations, there is no guarantee that bed bugs will be eliminated from the treated site.  The 45-day service warranty is only effective if “elimination” is declared and this is subject to a variety of factors to include client cooperation in following recommendations, physical conditions of the structure etc.
        </div>
        <div>
            **	The 45-day service warranty will be null and void if it is determined that the occupant has taken actions that are likely to cause the re-introduction of bed bugs into the unit. Examples include but are not limited to the  introduction of new or used furniture or any other infested items not previously in unit, new occupants living in the apartment unit that were not previously occupying the unit and transient activity of persons associated with the unit.
        </div>
        <div>
            The client agrees to all provisions of the Verification Inspection (if applicable).
            The client agrees to all provisions of Follow-up Services for Bed bugs and understands all follow-up services discussed in this agreement are bound by the Terms of the Follow-up Inspection terms and conditions.  (Separate agreement.)

                    As part of the bed bug program Interstate Pest Management will require access to the infested areas.  If follow-up visits DO NOT happen on days 10-12 after the initial treatment and 14 day intervals, the length of the program will in most cases be extended.  In the event follow-ups cannot be scheduled, the client acknowledges that the price of the follow-ups will increase based on the severity of the problem when the follow-up is eventually performed.
